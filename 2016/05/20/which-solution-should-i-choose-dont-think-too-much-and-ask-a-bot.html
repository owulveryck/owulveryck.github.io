The family tradition is to come back with a bunch of &ldquo;Pains au Chocolat&rdquo; (which, are, you can trust me, simply excellent).</p><ul><li><em>hello sir, I&rsquo;d like 4 of your excellent &ldquo;pains au chocolat&rdquo; please</em></li><li><em>I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t have any &ldquo;pains au chocolat&rdquo; nor any &ldquo;croissant&rdquo; anymore</em></li><li><em>what? How is it possible ?</em></li><li><em>everything has been sold.</em></li><li><em>too bad&hellip;</em></li></ul><p>I think to myself: <em>why didn&rsquo;t you made more?</em>. He may have read my thought and told me</p><ul><li><em>I wish I could have foreseen</em></li></ul><p>When I left his shop, his words were echoing&hellip; I wish I could have foreseen&hellip; We have self-driving cars, we have the Internet,
we are a civilization that is technology advanced.
Facebook recognize your face among billions as soon as you post a photo&hellip; It must be possible to foresee&hellip;</p><p>This is how I started to gain interest in machine learning</p><p>At first I started to read some papers, then I learn (a very little bit) about graph theory, Bayesian networks, Markov chains.
But I was not accurate and I felt I was missing some basic theory.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the main reason why, 8 weeks ago, I signed in a course about <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>&ldquo;Machine learning&rdquo; on Coursera</a>.
This course is given by <a href=http://www.andrewng.org/>Andrew Ng</a> from <a href=https://www.stanford.edu/>Stanford University</a>.</p><p>It is an excellent introduction that gives me all the tools I need to go deeper in this science. The course is based on real examples
and uses powerful mathematics without going too deeply in the proofs.</p><h1 id=so-what>So what?</h1><p>The course is not finished yet, but after about 8 weeks, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about what we call &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;.</p><p>The main idea of the machine learning is:</p><ul><li>to feed some code with a bunch of data (who said big data was useless)</li><li>to code or encode some mathematical formulas that could represent the data</li><li>to implement any algorithm that optimize the formulas by minimizing the error made by the machine on the evolving data sets.</li></ul><p>To make it simple: machine learning is feeding a &ldquo;robot&rdquo; with data and teach him how to analyse the errors so it can make decisions on its own.</p><p>Scary isn&rsquo;t it? But so exciting&hellip; As usual I won&rsquo;t go into ethical debate on this blog, and I will stick to science and on the benefit
of the science.</p><p>But indeed, always remind François Rabelais:</p><blockquote><p>Science sans conscience n&rsquo;est que ruine de l&rsquo;&acirc;me (<em>Science without conscience is but the ruin of the soul</em>)</p></blockquote><h2 id=a-use-case>A use case</h2><h3 id=defining-the-problem>Defining the problem</h3><p>I have 4 technical solutions providing a similar goal: deliver cloud services.
Actually, none of them is fulfilling all the requirements of my business.
As usual, one is good in a certain area, while another one is weak, etc.</p><p>A team of people has evaluated more than 100 criteria, and gave two quotations per criteria and per product:</p><ul><li>the first quotation is in the range 0/3 and indicated whether the product is fulfilling the current feature</li><li>the second quotation may be {0,1,3,9} and points the effort needed to reach a 3 for the feature</li></ul><p>Therefore, for each solution, I have a table looking like this :</p><table><thead><tr><th>feature name</th><th>feature evaluation</th><th>effort</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>feature 1</td><td>0</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>feature 2</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>feature 3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>feature 4</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>&hellip;&hellip;.</td><td>&hellip;</td><td>&hellip;</td></tr><tr><td>feature 100</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>I&rsquo;ve been asked to evaluate the product and to produce a comparison.</p><p>To do an analytic, I must look for an element of comparison. So I&rsquo;ve turned the problem into this :</p><p><strong>I would like to know which product is the cheapest to fulfill my requirement.</strong></p><p>(I&rsquo;ve uploaded my samples here):</p><ul><li><a href=/assets/ml/solution1.csv>solution 1</a></li><li><a href=/assets/ml/solution2.csv>solution 2</a></li><li><a href=/assets/ml/solution3.csv>solution 3</a></li><li><a href=/assets/ml/solution4.csv>solution 4</a></li></ul><h3 id=finding-a-solution>Finding a solution</h3><p>In the machine learning, we notice two different fields of application:</p><ul><li>regression</li><li>classification</li></ul><p>The classification mechanism would be used to answer a yes/no question; for example: <em>should I keep solution 1</em> ?
The regression mechanism helps us for &ldquo;predicting&rdquo;. Actually, the goal is to <em>automatically</em> find a mathematical formulae that turns
a set of feature into a result.</p><p>what is a feature, and what&rsquo;s the result?
Let&rsquo;s go back to my <em>petits pains</em> example.</p><p>Consider that the baker has made statistics on its production for sunday, and it has taken some events into consideration:</p><ul><li>sunday the 1st: it was raining, I sold only 100 petits Pains</li><li>sunday the 8th: it was sunny, I sold 250 petits Pains</li><li>sunday the 16th: it was sunny, and it was a special day (eg: mother&rsquo;s day): 300 petits Pains</li><li>sunday the 24th: it was cloudy: 150 petits Pains</li></ul><p>Here, the baker thinks that its production must be a function of the weather and the calendar; therefore those are the two features.
What ML propose is to tell the baker how many &ldquo;petits pains&rdquo; he should make <strong>knowing</strong> that it is a special day (father&rsquo;s day) and that it
is partially sunny&hellip;</p><p>Back in the context of this post, the goal of the regression would be to find a mathematical function that will tell me the effort needed
for any value, and doing this on the simple basis of the training set I have.</p><h4 id=the-actual-score-of-all-the-solutions>The actual score of all the solutions</h4><p>The first thing to find it the total score of all the 4 solutions.
If I consider $m$ features, the total score of the solution is defined by:</p><p>$ score = \frac{1}{m} . \sum_{k=1}^{m} feature_k $</p><p>What I need now, is to evaluate the effort needed to reach a score of 3 for each solution.
Let&rsquo;s do that.</p><h4 id=representing-the-training-set>Representing the training set</h4><p>First, let&rsquo;s plot the training set.
<center><img class=img-responsive src=/assets/images/ml/trainingset.jpg alt="Training set"></center></p><p><strong>note</strong> the representation is not accurate because there may be several bunk points</p><p>I will use in this post what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;supervised learning&rdquo;. That means that I will express a skeleton of function and let the machine
adjust it. (actually this is a very basic and week implementation; a lot more complex examples may be implemented but that&rsquo;s not the purpose of this post)</p><p>When I look at the training set representation, I can imagine a line passing by the middle of the plots.
This line may look like this:</p><p><center><img class=img-responsive src=/assets/images/ml/x-1_5.jpg alt=x^(-1/5)></center></p><p>This is actually a representation of the function $ x^{\frac{1}{5}} $</p><p>Let&rsquo;s assume that this function may basically fit my example, my goal will be to adapt the function.
assume this equation with two parameters $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ that will influence the curve:</p><p>$ f(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 . x^{\frac{1}{5}} $</p><p>Therefore, my goal will be to code something so that the machine will figure out what $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ are.</p><p>I will use an implementation of an algorithm called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent>gradient descent</a> for linear regression.
I won&rsquo;t go into the details of this algorithm, as it takes a complete course to be explained.</p><p>The implementation is made with <a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/>GNU octave</a> and the code is available on my <a href=https://github.com/owulveryck/linear-regression-example>github</a></p><h2 id=the-computation-and-the-result>The computation and the result</h2><p>Here is a figure representing the function for one particular solution:
<center><img class=img-responsive src=/assets/images/ml/trainingset_plot.jpg alt="Training set with the function"></center></p><p>We can see that the curve is &ldquo;under fitting&rdquo; the data.
Anyway, let&rsquo;s continue and get the result I want (I will explain later how to perform better):</p><p>Here are the computational results:<pre>

It&rsquo;s possible to go into further analysis to determine why it&rsquo;s the cheapest, and how the other ones
may catch up and go back in the race, but again, that is not the purpose of my post.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>This is a simple approach.
Some axis of optimization could be to use a more complex polynomial (eg: $\theta_0+\theta_1.x^\frac{1}{3}+\theta_2.x^\frac{1}{5}$)
or to use a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine>support vector machine</a> with a gaussian kernel for example.</p><p>One other optimization would be to add some more features, such as, for example, a score on the importance of a feature (a functional feature).</p><p>Machine learning is a wide mathematical and IT area. It is now in everyone&rsquo;s life.
Nowadays we are talking about plateform fully automated, self-healing applications, smart deployements, smart monitoring.
There are already some good implementations of algorithms on the market, but there is a huge place for integration of those tools into
the life of the IT specialist.</p><p>Automation has already helped and took the boring job of the IT specialist. Smart automation will go a step further.</p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span class=item-title>Author</span>
