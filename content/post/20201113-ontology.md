summary: "This is the first article about the concept of ontology. In this article, we introduce some ideas about semantic. From a set of definitions, we move to the notion of a knowledge graph. Then we show how triples and the turtle language can help setting up a schema and to represent knowledge"

Machine Learning leaves the impression that feeding a model with much data could produce a magical result. Moreover, machine learning gives the impression that it will smoothly bring a competitive advantage to a company.
The experience has shown that no model is powerful enough to understand structureless data.

To find a model representing information, there is a need to truly understand the shape of the knowledge hidden in the data.

We are talking about semantic here. This series of posts is about a way to express a semantic of data: ontology.

## About ontology

As defined in the introduction, the semantic purpose is to help organize the information to better understand the knowledge it carries.

The science behind the idea of describing a domain of knowledge by naming and categorizing things is called _taxonomy_.
A taxonomy is roughly a tree representing various elements of a field of expertise.

Ontology goes one step further by describing the relationship between the elements. It can be seen as a collection of various taxonomies representing a domain of knowledge and the relationships among them.

> An ontology is a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them (oxford dictionary).

More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject (Wikipedia).

Today most operational data has low semantic modeling and requires a manual, labor-intensive process to "map" the data before value creation can begin. Practical use of naming conventions and taxonomies can make it more cost-effective to analyze, visualize, and derive value from our operational data.

### Example

For example, I will take the same model as Mark Burgess in his book “In search of certainty”[^3]: representing knowledge regarding musical performances.

[^3]: [In Search of Certainty](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/in-search-of/9781491923337/) - [Mark Burgess](https://twitter.com/markburgess_osl) - Chapter 11. The Human Condition: How humans make friends to solve problems

Taxonomy helps to represent an artist, a record, and define that they are related.

Let's take this simple example:

![simple-record](/assets/simple-record.svg)

We see here that Peter Gabriel is linked to the album So.

Now consider this other tree:

![simple-record2](/assets/simple-record2.svg)

As a human, if you know enough pop/rock, you may know that Peter Gabriel is the record's performer. Maybe you know that Daniel Lanois is the producer… But none of this information is carried within the data.

Ontology is interesting because we apply metadata to the relationship itself.

## Semantic: subjects, predicates, objects

In plain English, we can express the information using simple sentences like:

- _"Peter Gabriel is the singer on the Album So."_
- _"Paul Lanois is the producer of the Album So."_

The rules of grammar give a model that explains the construction of those sentences. This model is a simple triple: _subject, predicate, object_.

_"Peter Gabriel"_ and _"Paul Lanois"_ are _subjects_ of the sentences, _"is the singer"_ and _"is the producer"_ _predicate_, and _"on/of the album So"_ are objects that complete the predicate.

This simple model, subject/predicate/object, is one of the tools that find a proper application on the AI field known as [_knowledge representation and reasoning (KR², KR&R)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning).

### Knowledge representation

_Knowledge-representation is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on designing computer representations that capture information about the world that can be used to solve complex problems._ (Wikipedia)

If knowledge is oil for digital companies, knowledge representation is its soil.

### Data expression

A datum is a way to express assets to make it processable by a computer (data is a set of datum). Information is a set of data, the meanings of whose parts are laid down by a group of language rules. Knowledge is a set of information.

To serialize the information (and therefore the knowledge), we can use data **and** apply the rule provided by the model subjects/predicates/objects.
