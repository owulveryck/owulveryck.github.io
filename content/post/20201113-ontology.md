tags: ["ontology", "taxonomy", "inference", "turtle", "rdf", "w3c"]
summary: "This is the first article about the concept of ontology. In this article, we introduce some ideas about semantic. From a set of definitions, we move to the notion of a knowledge graph. Then we show how triples and the turtle language can help setting up a schema and to represent knowledge"

Machine Learning leaves the impression that feeding a model with much data could produce a magical result. Moreover, machine learning gives the impression that it will smoothly bring a competitive advantage to a company.
The experience has shown that no model is powerful enough to understand structureless data.

To find a model representing information, there is a need to truly understand the shape of the knowledge hidden in the data.

We are talking about semantic here. This series of posts is about a way to express a semantic of data: ontology.

## About ontology

As defined in the introduction, the semantic purpose is to help organize the information to better understand the knowledge it carries.

The science behind the idea of describing a domain of knowledge by naming and categorizing things is called _taxonomy_.
A taxonomy is roughly a tree representing various elements of a domain of knowledge.

Ontology goes one step further by describing the relationship between the elements. It can be seen as a collection of various taxonomies that can represent a domain of knowledge and the relationships among them.

> An ontology is a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them (oxford dictionary).

More simply, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject (Wikipedia).

Today most operational data has low semantic modeling and requires a manual, labor-intensive process to "map" the data before value creation can begin. Practical use of naming conventions and taxonomies can make it more cost-effective to analyze, visualize, and derive value from our operational data.

### Example

For example, I will take the same model as Mark Burgess in his book “In search of certainty”[^3]: representing knowledge regarding musical performances.

[^3]: [In Search of Certainty](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/in-search-of/9781491923337/) - [Mark Burgess](https://twitter.com/markburgess_osl) - Chapter 11. The Human Condition: How humans make friends to solve problems

Taxonomy helps to represent an artist, a record, and define that they are related.

Let's take this simple example:

![simple-record](/assets/simple-record.svg)

We see here that Peter Gabriel is linked to the album So.

Now consider this other tree:

![simple-record2](/assets/simple-record2.svg)

As a human, if you know enough pop/rock, you may know that Peter Gabriel is the record's performer. Maybe you know that Daniel Lanois is the producer… But none of this information is carried within the data.

Ontology is interesting because we apply metadata to the relationship itself.
