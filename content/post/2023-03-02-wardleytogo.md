Wardley Maps are a way of expressing business, market, or any other system through sketching. The Map is a sketch that offers situational awareness on a certain topic.

As a sketch, the obvious way to draw a map is with paper and pen. 
While it is an excellent starting point, a paper representation of a map has a problem: it is static.  
What I mean by this is that adjusting the placement of some components in the design phase can be tedious (even with a good rubber pencil).

Representing a map in a digital way presents a couple of advantages: they are easy to share, and easy to maintain and to exploit.

Maintaining a map, is, in my context, the possibility to make some adjustements without changing its meaning (think of it as an adjustement that can occur after a discussion with some peers).
Exploiting a map is about exploiting the representation to orient, and then decide and act. 

An important point to keep in mind when mapping is that a map shall not be used to illustrate the story you want to tell, the story should be extracted from the map.


## Maps as code

## Taking my map "to go"

### Versioning the Map

### Basic need: CI 

## Building a SDK to draw map "as code"

## A high level language to express map "as data"

### The Euclidean representation

### Wardley Map: toward system 1

### Thinking about value chain and components

### A computer language to shape the way we think
