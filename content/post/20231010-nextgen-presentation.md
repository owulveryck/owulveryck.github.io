summary: In the digital age, traditional PowerPoint presentations often fail to engage audiences due to their static nature. 
  

  Research suggests that audience attention dwindles after just 10 minutes without engagement. 
  
  The proposed method in this article aims to revitalize presentations by
  
  * Incorporating live doodling with the assistance of tools like the reMarkable tablet for real-time interaction.
  
  * Using a script to create PDFs from images, blending the familiar structure of slides with spontaneous on-the-spot drawing.
   

  The result is a more authentic, engaging, and impactful presentation experience, though it requires deeper preparation and understanding of the topic. 
  
  The tools and methods highlighted aim to shift the focus from aesthetics to genuine content engagement.

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, traditional presentations often fall short of engaging audiences. 

Their static and pre-prepared nature lacks the interactivity and dynamism necessary to capture attention.

We no longer expose "_power points_" or "_key notes_" as we did in the days of _transparencies_ and _overhead projectors_ 
(see the impressive presentation [_growing a language_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0) by _Guy L. Steele Jr._ as an illustration, even though the content is unrelated with this article, his use of transparencies is interesting).

**Slides** have evolved **from a supportive role** to becoming the main focus, where **they are the presentation**.

I've sat through countless dull presentations where attendees are often found dozing off in front of endless static slides.

In contrast, at tech conferences where I have the pleasure of witnessing live demos, the audience is noticeably more enthusiastic. It's no surprise that the _scrum_ framework incorporates demos.

However, not every presentation can be demo-centric. So, I'm exploring a new approach to enhance interactivity and engagement while maintaining a structured format.

This article explores my approach and the tools I use. While I don't claim to have **the definitive method** (as many others exist), I'm sharing my personal techniques on this tech blog in the hopes they might be helpful to someone.

## The situation 

### The science behind engagement

According to Dr. John Medina's "Brain Rules", attention begins to wane after about 10 minutes without engagement. Research from the University of Maryland highlights the enhanced performance in environments that prioritize active and engaging methods.

### Real-World Application
Popular platforms like TED Talks exemplify these principles. Their presentations are concise and engaging, keeping the audience's attention from start to finish.

### A Fresh Approach
Imagine integrating live doodling into a presentation. This dynamic method combines the strengths of static slides with the spontaneity of on-the-spot drawing. The result? A presentation that resonates, captivates, and truly engages.

### The Trade-offs
While traditional slides offer a safety net for presenters, helping them stay on track, live doodling requires thorough preparation. One must understand their topic deeply to maintain fluidity and confidence throughout the presentation.

## Tooling: Bringing the Presentation to Life

### Streaming with reMarkable
One of the key tools that enable this dynamic presentation style is the reMarkable tablet. It's not just a device for note-taking or reading; it's a powerful streaming tool that brings the essence of live doodling to the forefront. With its seamless streaming capabilities, I can draw and doodle in real-time, making my presentations lively and interactive.

### Emulating Slides with a Script
To blend the traditional with the new, I utilize a script that converts a collection of images into a PDF. This emulates the slide structure we're familiar with but with a twist â€“ these "slides" can be written on, ensuring that while there's a base to the presentation, the real-time interaction remains intact.

### Integration is Key
Both the reMarkable streaming and the image-to-PDF script are instrumental in bridging the gap between static presentations and dynamic interactions. They empower the presenter, offering flexibility, spontaneity, and genuine engagement in the presentation journey.

## Conclusion
The age-old saying, "Form follows function," holds true even for presentations. While the traditional method prioritizes aesthetics, the dynamic approach emphasizes content and genuine engagement. It's a shift from simply reading slides to truly understanding and effectively communicating a topic's essence. This approach may demand more effort but promises a more authentic and impactful presentation experience.
