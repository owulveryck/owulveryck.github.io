summary: In the digital age, traditional PowerPoint presentations often fail to engage audiences due to their static nature. 
  

  Research suggests that audience attention dwindles after just 10 minutes without engagement. 
  
  The proposed method in this article aims to revitalize presentations by
  
  * Incorporating live doodling with the assistance of tools like the reMarkable tablet for real-time interaction.
  
  * Using a script to create PDFs from images, blending the familiar structure of slides with spontaneous on-the-spot drawing.
   

  The result is a more authentic, engaging, and impactful presentation experience, though it requires deeper preparation and understanding of the topic. 
  
  The tools and methods highlighted aim to shift the focus from aesthetics to genuine content engagement.
