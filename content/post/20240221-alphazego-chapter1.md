I have always been fascinated by Artificial intelligence applied to games.

Recently, I have watched the movie ["war games"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames) from 1983. This gave me the envy to play with those board games again.
I like the idea of a computer playing a game without being explicitly programmed to do so.

I've also (re)-watched the movie ["AlphaGo"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&themeRefresh=1). I have been fascinated by AlphaGo (and later by AlphaZero).
The main idea I liked is the idea of reinforcment learning: the machine learning by itself by learning from its mistakes.
