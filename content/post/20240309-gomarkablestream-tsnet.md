In the height of the work-from-home era, I developed goMarkableStream, a tool designed to seamlessly stream content from my reMarkable tablet during video callsâ€”a solution 
that proved invaluable for remote collaboration and sharing ideas in real time.

I've shared the details of this creation on this blog, highlighting how it bridged the gap between digital and handwritten content in virtual meetings.

However, as the full-time remote work phase has waned and we've transitioned back to a more mobile lifestyle, my needs have evolved.

### Solution: setup a VPN

### Why WireGuard and Tailscale?

In traditional VPN protocols, such as IPsec or OpenVPN, the VPN connection is typically tied to the IP address of the connecting device.
If the device's IP address changes (for example, when moving from one network to another), the VPN connection would usually drop, requiring a re-establishment of the connection under the new IP address.
This process can introduce delays and interruptions in connectivity.

#### WireGuard's Approach

WireGuard, on the other hand, takes a different approach that inherently supports seamless roaming:

- **Connection Identification:** WireGuard identifies connections not by the source or destination IP addresses but through the cryptographic identity of the peers (i.e., their public keys).
This means that as long as the cryptographic identity remains the same, WireGuard does not care if the actual IP address of a device changes.
- **Session Persistence:** When a WireGuard client moves to a different network and obtains a new IP address, it simply sends authenticated packets from its new IP to the WireGuard server (or peer).
The server recognizes the client by its public key and continues the session without interruption.
The server then automatically updates its internal routing table with the clientâ€™s new IP address, maintaining the encrypted tunnel without needing to re-establish the connection.
- **Rapid Response:** This mechanism allows for almost instantaneous switching between networks.
Users typically do not notice any disruption in their VPN connection as they move across different networks, making WireGuard particularly suited for mobile devices that frequently change network environments.

#### Benefits of Roaming

The roaming feature offers several practical benefits:

- **Uninterrupted Connectivity:** Users experience seamless transitions between networks without losing VPN protection or experiencing drops in their connections.
- **Improved User Experience:** The seamless nature of roaming with WireGuard enhances the overall user experience, as there are no manual reconnections or VPN downtime during network changes.
- **Efficiency for Mobile Devices:** For devices that switch networks often, WireGuard's efficient handling of IP changes ensures minimal battery consumption and resource usage compared to protocols that require re-establishing connections.

In summary, WireGuard's roaming capability is a significant advancement in VPN technology, providing users with stable, continuous connectivity across different networks and enhancing the usability of VPNs on mobile devices and in dynamic network environments."

### Challenges and Solutions in Integration

TODO: explain how I tried to implement tailscalem but the kernel of the remarkable does not support tunneling, therefore I must choose a solution that works in userspace.

### Introduction to the tsnet Library

> tsnet is a library that lets you embed Tailscale inside of a Go program.
This uses a userspace TCP/IP networking stack and makes direct connections to your nodes over your tailnet just like any other machine on your tailnet would.
When combined with other features of Tailscale, this lets you create new and interesting ways to use computers that you would have never thought about before.


### Security Considerations

- **VPN Security:** Outline the security measures inherent in using WireGuard and Tailscale, such as end-to-end encryption.
- **Additional Security Measures:** Describe any extra steps taken to ensure data privacy and protection, like network segmentation or access controls.

### Configuration and Setup

- **Setting Up Tailscale and WireGuard:** Provide a step-by-step guide on configuring Tailscale on the reMarkable and setting up WireGuard VPN.
- **Cloud Machine as Gateway:** Explain how you configured the cloud machine to act as a gateway and the role of the reverse proxy in this setup.

### Reverse Proxy and TLS Management

- **Role of the Reverse Proxy:** Detail how the reverse proxy manages traffic and facilitates secure access to your network.
- **Automating TLS with Let's Encrypt:** Describe the process of obtaining and renewing TLS certificates automatically to keep connections secure.

### Practical Benefits and Use Cases

- **Enhanced Accessibility:** Share how accessing the reMarkable's streaming service remotely has improved your workflow or use cases.
- **Examples of Benefits:** Provide specific examples or scenarios where this setup has been particularly beneficial.

### Performance and Reliability

- **Impact on Device Performance:** Discuss any observed effects on the reMarkable's performance or battery life.
- **Reliability of the Setup:** Share insights on the setup's reliability, including any downtime or connectivity issues experienced.

### Future Improvements and Expansions

- **Planned Enhancements:** Talk about potential future improvements or expansions, such as adding more devices to the VPN network.
- **Security Enhancements:** Consider future security measures that could further protect your setup.

### Conclusion

- **Recap:** Summarize the key points discussed in the article and the benefits of your setup.
- **Encouragement:** Encourage readers to explore the possibilities of VPNs and secure networking for their own projects.
