In today's hyper-competitive world, businesses no longer rely solely on gut decisions or intuition; they depend on **data-driven insights** to stay agile and make fast, smart decisions.
However, data alone isn't the answer; it's the enabler to create momentum on a **business & technology flywheel**:
a model where data drives decisions, decisions drive actions, and those actions drive value, propelling the business forward in a self-reinforcing cycle.

In a [previous post](https://blog.owulveryck.info/2024/04/09/data-as-a-product-and-data-contract-an-evolutionary-approach-to-data-maturity.html), I used a model to explain how data could cross the borders of applications and domains to bring increasing value at the organizational level.

In this post, I am attempting to adapt this cycle and determine what is required to activate a value flywheel effect from a joint technological and business perspective.

### The problem

As a **technological consultant** specializing in **data management**, I help organizations unlock **business value** through the effective use of data.
My focus is on the **analytics world**, where data possesses a **temporal dimension** and is used to derive actionable **insights** that drive better business decisions.

However, a key challenge for most companies lies in ensuring that these insights are properly **aligned with the business definitions** and goals.
Without this alignment, the insights—no matter how accurate or comprehensive—can lose their relevance and ultimately fail to deliver the intended value.

In many large organizations, data is often **managed in silos**, creating an artificial separation between **data teams** and **business teams**.
This disconnect makes it difficult to align data insights with actual business needs and hampers effective collaboration across departments.
Even when teams manage to gather the right data, the **lack of alignment** across the organization can result in **misinterpretation or underutilization** of that data.

One solution that some organizations have embraced is a **4-in-the-box (4ITB)** model, initially [pioneered by Walmart](http://thomasmisner.com/download/Thomas-Misner_Product-Ways-Of-Working-Presentation.pdf).
The 4ITB model brings together **cross-functional teams** involving stakeholders like Product Managers, Engineers, Data Experts, Business Representatives, and potentially others (N-ITB) to collaboratively solve business challenges.
It aims to establish both **horizontal alignment** (across departments) and **vertical alignment** (with leadership's vision) for every project.

In this model, **data** is treated as a critical part of the problem-solving process and "included in the box" alongside the other key functions.
While this improves collaborative efficiency, it also introduces new challenges as data becomes more integrated into everyday operations.
Specifically, even when data is brought into the 4ITB model, maintaining **alignment across domains** and dealing with **cross-domain data** (i.e., data that impacts multiple parts of the organization) remains a significant hurdle.
Successfully overcoming this requires a more coordinated approach to data management—one that can handle domain-specific needs while enabling **cross-organization value generation**.

To overcome these challenges of misalignment and cross-domain data handling, many organizations still find value in maintaining a central data team.
This team plays a pivotal role by supporting the holistic needs of the entire organization, especially when dealing with data at scale and ensuring it's available, compliant, and useful across all departments.

This central data team, often dubbed the data factory, is responsible for standardizing data processes, ensuring consistent access to analytics, and delivering technical capabilities that empower each domain to leverage data more effectively.
By operating as both a central service and an enabler, the data factory helps bridge the gap between business needs and technical expertise.
Think of it as the core infrastructure that powers the end-to-end data lifecycle—from collection and curation to storage, governance, and exposure for insights.

The data factory is, therefore, in chager of fighting the inertia of the system and triggering a value flywheel effect.

### **What is the Value Flywheel Effect?**

I have met the concept of the value flywheel in the book [The Value Flywheel Effect](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-value-flywheel-effect/) by David Anderson, with Mark McCann and Michael O’Reilly.

I love the introduction with the idea of momentum and I will simply copy here the very beginning of the book that you can find on the [website of IT Revolution](https://itrevolution.com/articles/what-is-the-value-flywheel/) for free:

> Momentum is a strange thing.
> It’s difficult to imagine what it will feel like and takes a great deal of effort to achieve.
> When we learn to ride a bicycle, for example, it feels clunky and awkward at first.
> It’s hard to get the wheels turning in the beginning, and our frustration is often evident.
> But our teacher assures us that it will pass.
> When we finally start to build momentum, the exhilaration takes our breath away.
> Every push of the pedal gets easier and takes less effort.
> Suddenly we can focus on the larger experience of gliding through a beautiful forest or tree-lined street.
> The value of our hard work is evident, and we can now continue to reap the benefits with less and less toil.

To fully understand the **value flywheel effect**, let’s first consider it from a broader business perspective.
The most well-known application of the flywheel effect comes from Amazon, where small wins in customer satisfaction lead to more traffic, which attracts third-party sellers, which in turn results in lower costs and prices, creating further momentum.
Each element strengthens the next, creating an ever-accelerating hub of growth, efficiency, and differentiated value.

The flywheel model describes a **self-reinforcing system** of momentum, growing stronger and easier to maintain as different actions compound over time.
Instead of relying on giant, one-time shifts or changes, the flywheel works by multiplying the effects of **small, consistent improvements**.
Once it's moving, it's hard to stop.

My goal is to use this model to see how it fits in the data landscape.
I see a lot of data models and organizations that sometimes lack clarity of purpose or the long term value.

I will use the model from the book I mentioned earlier, "_The Value Flywheel Effect_," which is a third iteration of the model (following Amazon and the original idea from [Jim Collins](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html)).
This model is well-documented in the book, and I strongly recommend that you read it.

### The Value Flywheel Effect: Four Phases for Transition

The **Value Flywheel Effect** occurs in four key phases, each of which represents a strategic milestone in spinning the value creation flywheel.
I’ll explain each phase, outlining the **key tenets**, the **people in charge**, their **objectives**, and how to **activate the value flywheel** at each stage.

#### Phase 1

Clarity of Purpose

The first phase is about establishing **Clarity of Purpose**.
To create business value from data, the people working in the **data factory** need to understand the purpose of their work and how it supports broader company objectives.

- **Key Tenets**: Alignment on **business goals**, connecting data initiatives directly to business outcomes.
- **People in Charge**: Leadership, Executive Sponsors, and Domain Experts.
- **Goal**: Ensure that both data and business teams are working towards the same strategic goals, thus preventing misalignment in expectations or priorities.

At this stage, the central data factory needs to focus on aligning its capabilities with **business priorities**.
This clarity will guide the roles and direction for the team moving forward and ensures that data outputs lead to insights that can create real value.

#### Phase 2

Challenge and Landscape

Next comes **Challenge and Landscape**, which focuses on identifying **key obstacles** and understanding the **current technological and business landscape**.
This phase might reveal that certain systems and processes need to be updated to meet modern data demands or **gaps in domain-level data ownership**.

- **Key Tenets**: Awareness of technological **debt**, bottlenecks, and organizational inefficiencies.
- **People in Charge**: Engineering: Technology Leads, Data Engineers, ...
- **Goal**: Examine the current infrastructure, tools, and systems in place and identify what challenges exist that may slow downs the spinning of the flywheel.

During this phase, it's crucial for the **data factory team** to get an accurate picture of **which challenges**—be it technical, cultural, or operational—are preventing them from scaling or accelerating their value generation.
By mapping these obstacles, I help guide my clients towards addressing the most pressing issues while also identifying new opportunities.

#### Phase 3

Next Best Action

Once the landscape is clear, the focus moves to identifying the **Next Best Action**:
what small, **incremental** improvements can be made that will begin turning the flywheel? At this stage, it’s about **empowering teams to take ownership** and starting to decentralize responsibility without overwhelming them.

- **Key Tenets**: **Iterative progress, agile development**, unlocking quick wins, and decentralizing responsibilities.
- **People in Charge**: Domain Leaders, Product Teams, and Data Engineers.
- **Goal**: Focus on the **minimum viable actions** necessary to eliminate the identified pain points, and **prioritize pragmatic solutions** that bring value without over-complication.

Here, the **data factory** plays a pivotal role—it provides the foundational capabilities needed for domains to take charge of their **own data products**.
Small, actionable steps, like improving data accessibility or providing scalable infrastructure, can catalyze bigger leaps.

#### 4

Long-Term Value

Finally, the last phase revolves around establishing **Long-Term Value**.
This is where the flywheel effect becomes self-sustaining, where each domain confidently handles its own data products, and the **data factory** transitions to more of a **supportive, enabling role**.

- **Key Tenets**: A federated model where all teams are contributing to **shared goals** and creating sustainable value.
- **People in Charge**: Chief Data Officers (CDOs), Domain-specific Data Teams, Architects.
- **Goal**: Architect the system to work at **scale**, ensuring consistency, governance, and long-lasting value for the entire company.

At this stage, the **central data factory** should have evolved into more of a **platform provider**, focusing on empowering the individual domains while ensuring that the infrastructure is reliable, scalable, and repeatable.
By driving toward a **data-mesh**, this phase enables the system to generate value continuously, accelerating innovation for the business.

### Conclusion: Activating the Flywheel

The **value flywheel** is activated phase by phase, and the central **data factory** plays a major role throughout the journey towards a federated data management system, ensuring **cross-domain consistency** and delivering scalable solutions.
By following this structured approach, the data landscape becomes a coherent framework where each part of the organization—not just the central data team—can contribute to the company’s **long-term success**.

The shift toward a **data-mesh** architecture ensures that all domains can spin the flywheel on their own, transforming data into actionable insights and kickstarting a virtuous cycle of value, innovation, and acceleration.
