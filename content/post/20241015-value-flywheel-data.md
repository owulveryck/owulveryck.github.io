In today's hyper-competitive world, businesses no longer rely solely on gut decisions or intuition; they depend on **data-driven insights** to stay agile and make fast, smart decisions.
However, data alone isn't the answer; it's the enabler to create a momentum on a **business & technology flywheel**:
a model where data drives decisions, decisions drive actions, and those actions drive value, propelling the business forward in a self-reinforcing cycle.

I a [previous post](https://blog.owulveryck.info/2024/04/09/data-as-a-product-and-data-contract-an-evolutionary-approach-to-data-maturity.html), I used a model to explain how data could cross the borders of applications and domains to bring increasing value at the organizational level.

In this post, I am attempting to adapt this cycle and determine what is required to activate a value flywheel effect from a joint technological and business perspective.

### **What is the Value Flywheel Effect?**

I have met the concept of the value fywheel in the book [The Value Flywheel Effect](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-value-flywheel-effect/) by David Anderson, with Mark McCann and Michael O’Reilly.

I love the introduction with the idea of momentum and I will simply copy here the very begining of the book that you can find on the [website of IT Revolution](https://itrevolution.com/articles/what-is-the-value-flywheel/) for free:

> Momentum is a strange thing.
> It’s difficult to imagine what it will feel like and takes a great deal of effort to achieve.
> When we learn to ride a bicycle, for example, it feels clunky and awkward at first.
> It’s hard to get the wheels turning in the beginning, and our frustration is often evident.
> But our teacher assures us that it will pass.
> When we finally start to build momentum, the exhilaration takes our breath away.
> Every push of the pedal gets easier and takes less effort.
> Suddenly we can focus on the larger experience of gliding through a beautiful forest or tree-lined street.
> The value of our hard work is evident, and we can now continue to reap the benefits with less and less toil.

To fully understand the **value flywheel effect**, let’s first consider it from a broader business perspective.
The most well-known application of the flywheel effect comes from Amazon, where small wins in customer satisfaction lead to more traffic, which attracts third-party sellers, which in turn results in lower costs and prices, creating further momentum.
Each element strengthens the next, creating an ever-accelerating hub of growth, efficiency, and differentiated value.

The flywheel model describes a **self-reinforcing system** of momentum, growing stronger and easier to maintain as different actions compound over time.
Instead of relying on giant, one-time shifts or changes, the flywheel works by multiplying the effects of **small, consistent improvements**.
Once it's moving, it's hard to stop.

#### **How Does This Relate to Data and Technology?**

Now, let’s translate this idea into the usage of **technology, data, and insights** within a business environment.

In a data-driven organization, **data usage operates within a broader flywheel of technology infrastructure**, decision-making, and business operations.
The value flywheel consists of **four key components** that interact:

1. **Data & Technology Infrastructure** – The foundation of data collection, storage, processing, and automation.
   This is your company's raw resource.
2. **Insights & Analytics** – Data isn’t useful on its own.
   It must be refined, curated, and interpreted to generate insights that drive decision-making.
3. **Business Decisions** – These insights fuel strategic business decisions in real-time, allowing for **adaptive actions** and creating value by solving customer problems, optimizing operations, or identifying market opportunities.
4. **Customer and Business Impact** – Better decisions lead to more effective products and services, happier customers, and more efficient business processes.
   This results in **improved outcomes** and financial gain for the organization.

These four components interact in a continuous loop:

- Better **data and technology** infrastructure provides higher-quality insights,
- Which in turn enables smarter **business decisions**,
- Which drive more effective **actions** and improved outcomes,
- Which then contributes back to the **technology investment** and data ecosystem, allowing you to collect more useful data and drive even better business decisions.

As each cycle turns, the flywheel **builds momentum**, and small inputs lead to accelerating value.
The more you use technology and data to drive decisions, the easier it becomes to generate future insights, make smarter decisions, and create compounding growth for the business.

### **The Role of Data in Building Momentum**

Data is the **fuel** for this flywheel.
Imagine it as the **input** component, feeding valuable insights into the decision-making process.
However, the real power comes not just through acquiring more data, but in how you use and operationalize the data.

This is where momentum comes in:

- **Data Collection and Processing**: The better your data infrastructure—the more aligned it is with your business needs—the easier it is to produce reliable insights.
- **Insights as Accelerators**: **Data-driven insights** enable leaders to make informed decisions that impact products, services, and customer experience.
- **Impact on Business**: These decisions don’t just sit in isolation; they lead to **actions** that improve the business—whether reducing costs, improving customer satisfaction, or opening new revenue streams.
- **Feedback Loop**: The more efficient your flywheel becomes, the more **momentum** it gains, continuing to churn out better decisions, more insights, and a greater competitive edge.

#### **The First Spin is Always the Hardest**

Getting started with the value flywheel can be difficult, especially when you don’t know how to **operationalize the data** or how to align technology with business outcomes.
But the important thing is to make the **first spin**—to gather data, begin generating insights or metrics, and take action, even if those actions are small or experimental.

Like any flywheel, the more it spins, the easier it becomes to maintain the momentum, and the more value you derive from each cycle.

### **Kickstarting Your Own Technology Flywheel with Data**

So how do you start? The central thesis of this presentation is simple: To **kickstart your value flywheel**, **data** must be treated as a **strategic enabler** within your organization.
This requires you to invest in proper technology infrastructure, build **data-as-a-product** capabilities, and leverage insights to power decision-making.

Over the next few slides, we will cover how you can:

1. Use **data-as-a-product thinking** to break out of silos and ensure data usage serves broader business decisions.
2. Implement **data contracts** to standardize and govern data interactions between different business units.
3. Build momentum in your flywheel by generating initial, small **wins** that eventually compound into greater insights and business value.
4. Leverage data to improve **customer experience, operational efficiency, and long-term growth**.

Once all of these components interact, you’ll witness the power of how data fits into the larger **technology-business flywheel** and propels your organization toward lasting, sustained success.

Now, let's dive into **how to start using data as a product**.
This will serve as the critical first step toward spinning your flywheel and unlocking value for your business.

### Final Thoughts

In this version, I’ve framed **data** as a **critical component** of the technology flywheel that propels **business outcomes**.
I’ve avoided making data the sole focus but instead emphasized its role as an **input** that feeds into the entire flywheel system, impacting decisions and eventually driving compounding value through a self-reinforcing feedback loop.

This approach aligns with the idea that data is part of a broader system of technology, insights, and business actions, with business **momentum** building as processes become more efficient over time.
You can use this structure in the presentation to explain how various parts of an organization need to work in tandem for the flywheel to generate long-term value.
