## Introduction
C4 (Context, Containers, Components, and Code) is a powerful and flexible approach to visualizing software architectures. 
In this article, we'll explore how I effectively use the C4 tool based on CUE to organize my code, handle tags, manage versioning, and integrate with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems to generate and update diagrams. 
We'll also discuss the benefits of generating diagrams on push and on demand, comparing it with other tools like Mermaid.

## Code Organization and Packages
To make the most of the C4 model, it's essential to maintain a clear and logical structure in your codebase. 
We'll discuss how I leverage the notion of packages to group related code elements, making it easier to understand the overall architecture, reduce complexity, and facilitate collaboration.

### Handling Tags
Tagging is a vital aspect of C4, as it helps identify and differentiate elements within diagrams. 
We'll discuss the importance of a well-defined tagging system for maintaining consistency and clarity throughout the architecture. 
We'll also share the tagging conventions and best practices I use to ensure that my diagrams are both informative and easy to navigate.

## HAndling diagrams as code

### Versioning
Software architectures evolve over time, and it's important to track these changes effectively. 
In this section, we'll delve into how I manage versioning in my C4 diagrams, ensuring that each update is well-documented and easily accessible to stakeholders.

### CI/CD Integration for Diagram Generation
Automation is key to maintaining up-to-date architecture diagrams. 
Here, we'll discuss how I've integrated C4 into my CI/CD pipeline, automating the process of generating and updating diagrams whenever changes are made to the codebase.

### Generation on Push vs. Generation on Demand:
When it comes to generating architecture diagrams, there are two main approaches: generation on push and generation on demand. 
We'll compare these methods and discuss how they differ from tools like Mermaid. 
We'll also share the pros and cons of each approach and explain why I chose the method I use in my projects.

## Conclusion:
The C4 model offers a powerful way to visualize software architecture, but harnessing its full potential requires careful organization, tagging, versioning, and automation. 
By implementing these strategies and understanding the benefits of generating diagrams on push or on demand, you'll be well-equipped to create clear,
consistent, and up-to-date representations of your software systems that facilitate collaboration and understanding among stakeholders.
