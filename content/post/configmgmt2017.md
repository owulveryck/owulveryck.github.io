title: Configuration management is a solved problem!
---

This year, I have attended to the configuration management camp in gent thanks to [Techsys](http://www.techsys.fr).
It is the second year I attend to those conferences.
Last year, as I mentionned in [my review](/2016/02/10/configuration-management-choreography-and-self-aware-applications/index.html) the main topic was about orchestration and choreography.

This year's edition was more about the maturity of the configuration management.

Actually, the title of this blog post is the same as the keynote given by John Vincent.

# The maturity of the tools

# The economy around the tools

# Containers...

## Operating systems are assholes

# Conclusion
