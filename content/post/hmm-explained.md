It's been about a year that I started to read the __tutorial on Hidden Markov Models and selected applications in speech recognition__ from Lawrence R. Rabiner.

This paper is a reference in term of HMM application. The problem was that even with a lot of effort and concentration, I was lacking a bunch of
skills to fully understand it.
As I've now studied a bit, with the support of Coursera and the lectures of Andrew Ng, I will try to dig into it again.

This post may not be published, but I think it may be useful to me.
Actually, rephrasing, explaining and trying to argument the publication from Rabiner will be, according to me, the best way to understand it.
