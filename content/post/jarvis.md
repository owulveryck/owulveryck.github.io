# introduction

As you may know, if you know me personally of if you read my blog, I'm a big fan of automation.

Automation alongside of machine learning could heavily improve the usage of IT and increase functional perspectives.
Indeed, automation is not a reserved principle of continuous integration; automation is not only targeted to ease the life of operation engineers
or a tool to lower the costs.

Automation (and machine learning) may also be used for everyday life.

Few days ago I had to present some of my work to a team of automation convicted people. People that develop and integrate continuous integration pipes;
other people that does the same with an orchestration engine and people who are the targeted people of the automation process. Those who will really take advantage of a fully automation integration and management pipeline.

Anyway, I wanted to introduce myself simply by showing them my dream of automation.

# The principle

I wanted a demo related to my experience as an operation and infrastructure manager. Therefore the best example would be to ask my "household Butler" to create a virtual machine in the cloud for me, and to setup a DNS to ease the external access.
