# Introduction

## From a container of data to a data processor

Object storage and cloud computing have changed the paradigm of data storage: you don't unmarshal the data to make it fit in structured storage anymore. Nowadays, you use blob storage to store the document as close as possible to its original form.

The value is not gold by the document itself anymore. What's important now is the history of changes applied to the document.

### the paradigm shift

For a long time in the history of IT, people have stored data, and building an application was more or less simply desinging a view on top of the data storage.
