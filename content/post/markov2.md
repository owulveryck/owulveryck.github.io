What we do here is online learning because it is not possible to provide a set of data.
Actually, if the expectation is part of predetermined vector of states ($\{start, stop, confgure,...\}) for any topology,
the way to achieve the goal and reach the state __is__ different for every topology (the deployement plan is different).

We have to define the universe in which our machine evolve in order to bound the events that may interact with it.
