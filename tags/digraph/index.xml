They have changed the world a lot. From the simple representation to Bayesian network via Markov chains, the applications are numerous.
Today I would like to imagine a graph as a workflow of execution. Every node would be considered as runnable. And every edge would be a dependency.
It is an important framework that may be used to as an orchestrator for any model, and of course I am a lot thinkingabout TOSCA</description></item><item><title>TOSCA lifecycle as a digraph</title><link>https://owulveryck.github.io/2015/11/20/tosca-lifecycle-as-a-digraph/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 10:09:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owulveryck.github.io/2015/11/20/tosca-lifecycle-as-a-digraph/</guid><description>About TOSCA The TOSCA acronym stands for Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications. It&amp;rsquo;s an OASIS standard.
The purpose of the TOSCA project is to represent an application by its topology and formalize it using the TOSCA grammar.
The [TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.0] current specification in YAML introduces the following concepts.
TOSCA YAML service template: A YAML document artifact containing a (TOSCA) service template that represents a Cloud application. TOSCA processor: An engine or tool that is capable of parsing and interpreting a TOSCA YAML service template for a particular purpose.</description></item></channel></rss>
