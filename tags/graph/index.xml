I have decoded the information to reconstruct a graph. Now I propose to expand the principle and to create a proper execution backend based on Gorgonia. This post is a bit more technical than the previous one because all the concepts needed to work should be present in the last article.</description></item><item><title>My journey with ONNX and Go - The beginning</title><link>https://owulveryck.github.io/2018/08/14/my-journey-with-onnx-and-go-the-beginning.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:41:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owulveryck.github.io/2018/08/14/my-journey-with-onnx-and-go-the-beginning.html</guid><description>This year has started with a lot of deep thoughts about the software 2.0. My conclusion (which is slightly different from Andrej Karpathy&amp;rsquo;s consideration) is that a software 2.0 is a combination of a Neural network model and its associated weights. This is a concept; now the question is: how to materialize the idea? What artifact represents a software 2.0.
I emitted several ideas and tried one of them: to serialize the mathematical model and the weights.</description></item></channel></rss>
